You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges
where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between ai and bi in
the graph.

Return the number of connected components in the graph.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2000
1 <= edges.length <= 5000
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai <= bi < n
ai != bi
There are no repeated edges.
